# The Rising Sea – Solutions & Notes

This repository contains a comprehensive, self-contained write-up of selected exercises, theorems, and key results from Ravi Vakil’s *The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry* (August 2022 draft). All solutions were written independently by Jack Westbrook as part of a personal study of modern algebraic geometry.

## 📘 Overview

The notes aim to:
- Provide rigorous and clearly explained solutions to exercises across the text.
- Supplement core arguments with diagrams, background lemmas, and commentary when helpful.
- Serve as a reference for others studying Vakil’s text or preparing for graduate work in algebraic geometry.

Solutions are typeset in LaTeX and organized by chapter. The current scope includes Chapters 1–4, with ongoing work expanding into later sections as time allows.

## 🔍 Contents

- `solutions/` — LaTeX files organized by chapter.
- `main.pdf` — Compiled document with all completed chapters and exercises.
- `macros.tex` — Custom macros for category theory, sheaves, and algebraic geometry notation.

## ✍️ Authorship & Scope

All content in this repository is written by Jack Westbrook and reflects personal understanding of the material. Errors are my own. This is **not** an official solution manual and is shared solely for educational purposes.

Vakil has requested that no complete solutions be posted publicly. Therefore, this repository may be set to private or removed at any time, and may only be shared with permission or for academic application purposes.

## 🛠️ Tools

- Typeset in LaTeX using `pdflatex`
- Some diagrams created with TikZ
- Structure follows the August 2022 version of *The Rising Sea*
